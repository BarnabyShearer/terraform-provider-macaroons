# terraform-provider-macaroons

Macaroons are flexible authorization credentials that support decentralized delegation, attenuation, and verification. Given an existing credential this provider can attenuate it for a specific use.

At the moment it is tested for scoping a pypi.org's API token per project (PRs for other uses welcome).
